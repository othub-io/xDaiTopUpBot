# xDaiAutoTopUp

## Overview

`xDaiTopUpBot` is an automated balance monitoring and top-up system designed for xDai wallets (or any other EVM wallet). It ensures that multiple wallets maintain a minimum gas balance by automatically topping them up when their balance falls below a predefined threshold. Integrated with Telegram, `xDaiTopUpBot` sends instant notifications for balance alerts and top-up transactions, providing users with up-to-date information on their wallet status.

## Features

- **Multi-Wallet Monitoring**: Keep track of multiple xDai wallets and their balances simultaneously.
- **Automated Top-Up**: Automatically sends xDai to wallets when their balance drops below a specified threshold.
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends real-time alerts and transaction confirmations directly to a Telegram bot.
- **Secure and Private**: Uses environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as private keys and Telegram bot tokens.
- **Easy to Configure**: Customize wallet addresses, balance thresholds, and notification preferences through a simple configuration.
